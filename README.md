### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a professional with solid experience in support and infrastructure, currently working as a **Helpdesk Technician** at [Digisystem](https://www.digisystem.com.br/), where I solve technical challenges and ensure operational continuity.

My academic journey is focused on two strategic fronts:
- 🎓 **Software Engineering**: Deepening my knowledge in development, architecture, and the software lifecycle to create high-impact solutions.
- ☁️ **Cloud Engineering**: Focused on mastering the main cloud, Azure, to design and manage scalable, secure, and resilient infrastructures.

My goal is clear: to be a well-rounded IT professional with a 360º vision that spans from **Networking** and **Security** to **Development** and the **Cloud**. I believe that the synergy between these areas is the future of technology.
